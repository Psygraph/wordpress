The Psygraph WordPress plugin

## Please note that the most recent version of Psygraph (0.9.2) has dropped support for online connectivity. 
This plugin integrates with the Psygraph mobile app (an app that tracks your meditation, breathing, and mindfulness) to visualize your data in WordPress.  The provided shortcodes can do things like generate progress charts, show the history of meditation sessions, and allow playback of recorded audio notes.

Further documentation for both the app and the plugin is available at http://psygraph.com .

The latest release of the plugin code is hosted at GitHub, and stable revisions are available (and more easily installed) from within WordPress.
